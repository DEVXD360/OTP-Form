# OTP-Form
One-time Passwords (OTP) is a password that is valid for only one login session or transaction on a computer or a digital device. Nowadays OTP’s are used in almost every service like Internet Banking, online transactions, etc. They are generally a combination of 4 or 6 numeric digits or a 6-digit alphanumeric.

### I build the project using :

- ### HTML
-- HTML technology is responsible for the structuring and placement of the data. 
- It covers the way content is organized and where it is positioned on the page. It is the backbone.

- ### CSS 
 - CSS is responsible for the representation of the data. 
 - It includes colors, fonts, background stuff, peculiarities of a layout, etc.
