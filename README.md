### I build the project using :

- ### HTML
- HTML technology is responsible for the structuring and placement of the data. 
- It covers the way content is organized and where it is positioned on the page. It is the backbone.

- ### CSS 
- CSS is responsible for the representation of the data. 
- It includes colors, fonts, background stuff, peculiarities of a layout, etc.
